# Assessing the Climate Claim of Roy Spencer

In [Spencer (2021)](https://www.drroyspencer.com/2021/01/biden-to-end-fossil-fuel-subsidies-like-the-paris-agreement-it-will-make-no-difference/), he argues that the new executive order by the Biden Administration directing federal agencies to end fossil fuel subsidies, along with their promise to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, are not substantial. Specifically, he cites the miniscule proportion of fossil fuel revenue that are accounted by subsidies, as well as the low projected impact of Paris on global temperatures by 2100. Furthermore, he argues for the benefits of fossil fuel emissions, including economic growth, where countries like China are better able to lift their people out of poverty. This article is of particular interest because of its current relevance, not only in light of Biden’s recent climate efforts but perhaps more importantly, his plans to rejoin Paris.

At first glance, Spencer appears to be credible: he is meteorologist and researcher writing on current events. He includes statistics to support his point and purposefully writes that he does not personally have an opinion. However, upon closer scrutiny, his arguments weaken, and his bias becomes clear. He presents statistics in a misleading way to promote his views and is thus, not objective. His sources are also not peer-reviewed, but rather, are news pieces where the intent of original scientific work can be misconstrued.  

Central to the argument is that federal subsidies on fossil fuels “represent less than 3% of the revenues of the fossil fuel industry.” However, subsidies and tax benefits to the industry were estimated to be $5.2 trillion in 2017. The industry as a whole presented negative environmental and public health impacts totalling around $5.3 trillion globally in 2015. Regardless of the percentage of total revenue, revoking this privilege is projected to lower global carbon emissions by 28% and air pollution deaths by 46% [(EESI, 2019)](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs). With America being the second highest global subsidizer, these funds can be reinvested into renewable sources of energy [(EESI, 2019)](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs). Thus, it seems more plausible that Biden’s executive order will indeed significantly affect national carbon emissions.

Moreover, Spencer argues that rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement will have little measurable impact on global climate because America is no longer the primary emitter of greenhouse gases (Figure 1). While other sources confirm this, it is still worth pointing out that the US remains the second largest contributor to CO2 emissions: significantly more than the more-populous European Union [(Boden, Andres and Marland, 2017)](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/overview_2014.html). Although China currently emits more, the US has also been actively industrialized longer and thus, likely contributed significantly more over time [(US EPA, 2016)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data).

Figure 1: China accounts for 30% of the global CO2 emissions, with the US contributing 15%. However, note that the US remains the second largest contributor – larger than the European Union and India [(Boden, Andres and Marland, 2017](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/overview_2014.html).

This also presents a false equivalency. Spencer argues that with the projected impact of Paris being a 0.2°C reduction in warming by 2100, it is pointless to rejoin. This is not the case. Failure could have been devastating, pushing back the process another decade or so, and would have almost certainly resulted unstoppable 3°C warming by 2100 [(Clémençon, 2016)](https://doi-org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1177/1070496516631362). While it is unlikely that the global warming will be kept below the optimistic 1.5°C outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement, it is even more dangerous to suggest that we do not need it. The entire world, especially a key player like America, needs to cooperate in order to reach warming targets [(Rogelj et al., 2016)](https://www-nature-com.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/articles/nature18307?TB_iframe=true&width=370.8&height=658.8). A thorough cost-benefit analysis also indicated the minimum goal of 2°C can be economically favourable. This is because investing in future income also reduces economic losses from the climate and as such, the benefits of carbon emissions are outweighed by the costs [(Glanemann, Willner and Levermann, 2020)](https://www-nature-com.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/articles/s41467-019-13961-1). 

As such, Roy Spencer’s claim about the relatively little utility in Biden’s executive order to end fossil fuel subsidies and plans to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement appear credible on the surface, but upon further inspection, fall apart.
